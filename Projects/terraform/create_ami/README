Generete EC2 AMI in single step/process

1.Introduction
The problem AMI creation in EC2 is that one cannot create AMI without starting an instance first.
So in order to create an AMI , you will first need to start an EC2 instance and then create an Amazon Machine 
Instance(AMI) from it.
This introduces several steps in the creation process , namely : Start Instance , Create AMI , Destroy instance.

2.Solution
Hence to tackle this problem ,  the underlined Terraform infrastructure , provides a single step way to create an 
EC2 AMI.
It employs terraform configuration to perform the aforementioned steps under a single call. , i.e , as part of a 
single infra , it would :
-Start an instance
-Create an AMI from it
-Destroy the previously created instance

3.Components

The supplied infrastructure includes following main components :

a.)generate_ami.sh        : this shell will perform all the required tasks and generate an AMI.
b.)Main config            : This is the main config files which bootstrap underlying modules.
  --user_variables.tf     : You would populate the variables intialized in this script , or you can pass the variables 
    as overrides using the [-v/--var] option of the generate_ami.sh script. 
c.)Create Instance Module : This instance will govern the instance creation.You will write your privisioners here and 
                            copy the required files which will be part of the AMI.
d.)Create AMI Module      : This si the module which will create the AMI.
 

4.Usage 

./generate_ami --name <AMI_NAME> --var <OVERRIDEN VARS>

Example : 

./build_ami.sh -n "sample_ami" --var "aws_access_key=access_key" --var "aws_secret_key=secret_key" --var="aws_region=region" --var="aws_key_name=key_name" --var="aws_pem_file=key_file.pem"


P.S. : 

--Secret key and access keys are required to start instance and create ami.
--Key file is required by provsioners to ssh/scp into the created instance.
--Default base AMI in the user_variables.tf is Ubuntu's.Change it as per your requirement.
